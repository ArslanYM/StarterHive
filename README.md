## Contributing
Following are the steps to guide you:

### Step 1
- Fork this repository 

![fork](https://github.com/ArslanYM/StarterHive/assets/104521101/b2863384-753d-448b-9c8f-cc2122121c2b)


### Step 2:
- Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the code button and then click the copy to clipboard icon.

![clone](https://github.com/ArslanYM/StarterHive/assets/104521101/ffe2cb3b-d7e9-41fb-a7e6-8f5ca9d50dd0)

Open a terminal and run the following git command:
   ```
   git clone "url you just copied"
   
   ```
where "url you just copied" (without the quotation marks) is the url to this repository (your fork of this project). See the previous steps to obtain the url.

![opy](https://github.com/ArslanYM/StarterHive/assets/104521101/5947298f-dd52-478c-9cd9-f22791eea4a5)

The code will look something like this : 
```
git clone https://github.com/{your user name}/StarterHive.git

```


### Step 3: 
- Navigate to StarterHive on your device

```
cd StaterHive/

```
### Step 4:
- Add an upstream link to the main branch in your cloned repo

    ```
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/ArslanYM/StarterHive
    ```
- Keep your cloned repo up to date by pulling from upstream (this will also avoid any merge conflicts while committing new changes)
    ```
    git pull upstream main
    ```
### Step 5: 
- Create your feature branch (This is a necessary step, so don't skip it)
    ```
    git checkout -b <feature-name>
    ```
### Step 6: Make necessary changes and commit those changes
- Add your commits to the staging
   ```
   git add .
   ```
   
### Step 7:  Now commit those changes using the `git commit`  command:

    ```
    git commit -m "Write a meaningful but small commit message"
    ```
    
### Step 8: Push your changes using the command `git push` :
    ```
    git push -u origin your-branch-name
    
    ```
### Step 9:
- Create a PR on Github. (Don't just hit the create a pull request button, you must write a PR message to clarify why and what are you contributing)
