Follow these steps to contribute to the project:

- ### Step 1

  Fork this repository
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/ArslanYM/StarterHive/assets/104521101/b2863384-753d-448b-9c8f-cc2122121c2b" alt="fork" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
</p>

- ### Step 2:

  Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the code button and then click the copy to clipboard icon.

</p>

Open a terminal and run the following git command:

```bash
git clone "url you just copied"
```

where "url you just copied" (without the quotation marks) is the url to this repository (your fork of this project). See the previous steps to obtain the url.

</p>

The code will look something like this :

```bash
git clone https://github.com/{your user name}/StarterHive.git
```

- ### Step 3:

  Navigate to StarterHive on your device

  ```bash
  cd StaterHive/
  ```

- ### Step 4:

  - Add an upstream link to the main branch in your cloned repo

  ```bash
  git remote add upstream https://github.com/ArslanYM/StarterHive
  ```

  - Keep your cloned repo up to date by pulling from upstream (this will also avoid any merge conflicts while committing new changes)

  ```bash
  git pull upstream main
  ```

- ### Step 5:

  Create your feature branch (This is a necessary step, so don't skip it)

  ```bash
  git checkout -b <feature-name>
  ```

- ### Step 6: Make necessary changes and commit those changes

  Add your commits to the staging

  ```
  git add .
  ```

- ### Step 7: Commit the changes

  - Now commit those changes using the `git commit` command:

  ```bash
  git commit -m "Write a meaningful but small commit message"
  ```

  - Follow this [Guide](https://gist.github.com/tonibardina/9290fbc7d605b4f86919426e614fe692) for commit messages.

- ### Step 8: Push your code.

  Push your changes using the command `git push` :

  ```bash
  git push -u origin your-branch-name
  ```

- ### Step 9:

  Create a PR on Github. (Don't just hit the create a pull request button, you must write a PR message to clarify why and what are you contributing)
